# nScope-nodejs-addon
Addon for NodeJS for the nScope library

For more information about nScope see https://www.nscope.org/

This repository will create a NodeJS addon based on the nScope library (https://github.com/nLabs-nScope/nScopeAPI.git)

This is an initial version. This version works.

I am in the process of moving the differen function calls into a class as has already been done for the request.
